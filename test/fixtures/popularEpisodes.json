Alfie tries to step in and stop them arguing but Belinda’s words are cutting. Belinda cries and reminisces about Charlie’s time in Lanzarote, without Kat and her drama. Kat goes to attack Mo about the past but Belinda stands to leave. Kat is left numb. She asks Alfie to wake Stacey but there’s no reply. Kat wishes she stayed in Spain and Alfie comforts her.\n\n\n\n\n\nKat tells Alfie about Sister Ruth’s visit and that she has a son that she didn’t know about. She explains that Mo knew. Kat is convinced that the lottery money was cursed and no matter how hard she tries to leave Harry in her past he keeps getting to her. Alfie holds her. Kat fears death and her children hating her. Alfie decides that it’s time to tell her about the tumour on his brain. He tells her that it’s benign and that he isn’t in pain. He admits that he knew before they left for Spain. She grips on to him hard making him promise never to leave her. \n\n\n\n\n\nMartin sits with Stacey in their bedroom as she scribbles on a notepad a plan to keep the devil away. Martin asks her to promise that she won’t go on the roof again. She agrees, unless God tells her to. Alfie lets Martin know that Belinda has arrived and Kat needs Stacey’s support but Martin tells him she’s asleep. Nancy and Tamwar discuss Stacey’s frame of mind as they collect glasses in the Vic. Tamwar finds the baby bag and phone left by Kyle. Martin receives a call from Nancy about Stacey’s belongings whilst Stacey is busy with Arthur. He goes to collect them from the Vic and Nancy refuses to them hand over until he explains what’s wrong with Stacey. Martin says she wanted to be closer to Bradley. He goes to leave with the bag and Carmel asks if everything’s ok. Martin snaps at her wishing everyone would leave them alone. Alfie knocks on the door to Stacey’s room and she freezes with fear. Martin returns and Alfie asks if he’s ok and Martin admits he feels out of his depth. Alfie reassures him that he can be a support for Stacey. Martin enters the bedroom to find a petrified Stacey who asks him not to leave her again.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPhil returns home and Jay is waiting for him. The hospital rang and Sharon has rushed to see Dennis. Jay is meant to be going bowling with Jay and Abi and warns Phil that Sharon looked scared. Phil arrives to find Sharon with Dennis who is awake. She tells him that he has caught an MRSA infection as his wound is infected but he will be ok. They step outside to talk and she tells him how worried she was. She tells Phil that she needs him and will never forgive Ian. When they return home she thanks him and Phil decides to tell her the truth about who was driving the car Christmas day…\n\n\n\n\n\nCarmel finds Kush sat alone in the Square. He tells her about Stacey. Carmel tells him to be honest \n\nwith Shabnam. In 29B Shabnam asks after Stacey. When she finds out about the roof she gets up to go and see her, explaining that’s where Bradley died. Kush tells her to stay and talk about how they can move on together. He describes what happened between him and Stacey. Shabnam questions him on the details of that night. Shabnam asks if he loves Stacey but he makes it clear that she is the one he loves. Whilst say on her bed, Shabnam gets out Zaair’s box of memories and holds his blanket.\n\n\n\n\n\nKush tries to assure her that he has no feelings for Stacey or Arthur but Shabnam knows he has feelings for his son. Kush explains that he has wanted her from the minute he almost ran her over on the market. He says Arthur is Martin’s but Shabnam shuts this down. She busies herself in the kitchen and Kush suggests they move away from the Square. Shabnam points out that she cannot give him a son and they would resent each other. Kush begs her not to leave him. She goes to pack her bags."

In series two, Dan meets his semi-criminal Aunt Leslie, reignites romance with his now-pregnant old flame Holly and tries to prove his worth to his businessman dad Gregg. Hannah gets addicted to women's rugby, does a terrible job looking after an eight-year-old and has an unforgettable role in a cool music video.\n\nPerpetually jobless Dan is in debt to his mother Marion - after all, she pays the allowance that enables him to spend time writing his graphic novel Wolf Cops. That means that Dan is Marion's dance partner at her local salsa class, a role he begrudgingly accepts. He's got two left feet and is constantly weirded out by fellow dancer Ralph who seems to have an unhealthy interest in his own mother. But when Marion's sister, troublemaker Leslie, turns up unannounced, Dan decides to rebel. Aunt Leslie teaches him that you can take whatever you want from society and never have to give anything back, which Dan loves. Yet when Leslie decides to enact revenge on an old boyfriend, Dan quickly realises he is in way out of his depth.\n \nMeanwhile, Hannah is dreading heading in to work for the annual audit. However, criminal activity in the office above means that all staff get the week off while police investigate. Excited, she heads home, where she ends up becoming the owner of six free pizzas. As more unexpectedly good things start to come her way, Hannah becomes convinced she's having a golden week - an uninterrupted week of lucky breaks. When the opportunity to appear in a music video with her favourite R&B star appears, Hannah begins to believe she's invincible."

But Andrei's wise old commander General Kutuzov is concerned that Napoleon is setting a trap.\n\nBack in Russia, Natasha and her family are desperate to hear news from Nikolai. Pierre is married to Helene but struggles to settle into their life together. With his daughter happily coupled off, Prince Vassily's thoughts turn to marrying off his son Anatole. They travel to meet Andrei's sister, Marya, at Prince Bolkonsky's country estate. Marya is tempted by the unexpected prospect of romance, but her father is less convinced of Anatole's intentions."

Martin heads to the Vic where Nancy tells him Stacey is upstairs with Arthur. But when he searches for them he doesn’t notice the door to the roof, ajar. Nancy and Tamwar head upstairs and realise that Stacey is on the roof. Nancy tries to coax Stacey down whilst Tamwar finds Martin. Stacey is desperate to see the stars. She explains that demons are after her and Arthur. Nancy tried to get her inside before the storm hits but Stacey believes the storm is being sent to her by God. Martin asks Tamwar not to let anyone know about what has happened, for Stacey’s sake. Martin tells Nancy and Tamwar to head inside though they are reluctant. Martin moves towards Stacey and she edges backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe tells him Arthur isn’t his; he’s God’s. Kyle returns to the Vic to get his friends and tells them they need to go. He leaves the baby bag and Stacey’s phone on the bar. Stacey is waiting for a sign, a messenger from God. Martin plays along with her delusions. She allows him to come closer and he wraps Arthur in a blanket given to him by Nancy. Martin holds him and holds out his hand to Stacey to lead her home. Kush shouts for her from the Square. She trips and Martin saves her from falling. Martin guides her home and tells Nancy it was just the shock of Charlie’s death. Kush catches them on their way out of the Vic and is struggling with the fact that he can’t help Arthur. Once home, Stacey is comforted by Martin and tries to open the window so God can see them. Martin closes it and promises her he won’t let anyone take Arthur. \n\n\n\n\n\nBilly thanks the police outside Number 3 and prepares to collect Charlie’s body. Billy explains to Patrick that Charlie had a heart attack. Patrick goes to inform Dot. Charlie’s body is covered with a sheet on the sofa. Billy stares at him clutching the body bag, waiting for his work colleague to arrive. Alfie offers to help him after Kat and Mo have taken the children out of the room. Stacey returns with Martin and Arthur and Tommy has drawn a picture for Charlie. Kat struggles to explain Charlie’s death to the children and Alfie steps in to help. He says that Charlie is in heaven and is the brightest star in the sky. Stacey takes this in. Once the kids are put to bed, Kat thanks Alfie for always being there for her. Alfie looks at her, his mind on the test results. He tries to tell Kat but is interrupted by Mo and the entrance of Kat’s sister, Belinda. Belinda looks at Kat with hate and congratulates her for finally killing their dad… \n\n\n\n\n\nShabnam is distraught at the news that Kush is Arthur’s father and rushes to the door. Kush stops her from leaving and she locks herself in the bathroom. Carmel and Kush wait outside until Shabnam reappears. Martin arrives looking for Stacey and Shabnam tells him she saw her in the Square. She tells Kush to go and find them. Carmel explains that Kush was doing what he thought was best but Shabnam laughs at her, remembering the baby grow she gave to Stacey. She tells Carmel to go home. Shabnam sits alone whilst Kush searches for Stacey. She looks at her phone; nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nPhil and Sharon sit at the kitchen table discussing Charlie’s death and how Sharon felt when she found out Dennis was hurt on Christmas Day. She will never be able to let go of her hate for Ian. Phil sneaks into the cupboard under the stairs and retrieves a bottle of whiskey. He finishes it and heads to the Vic. Shirley serves him and asks what’s happened. Later she finds him in the Arches drinking alone in the dark. He receives a message from Sharon asking him to come to the hospital. Phil tells Shirley that Ian wasn’t driving the car on Christmas day. Shirley tells him to tell Sharon the truth."

Presenting duo Emma Willis and Marvin Humes return to helm the unmissable Saturday night entertainment show.\n \nThe contest kicks off with the blind auditions, where the coaches begin the process of building their 12-strong teams by sitting with their backs to the auditionees and turning their chairs if they are impressed with what they hear. If more than one coach turns, the hopeful has the chance to choose whose team they join - and the fireworks begin as the coaches pitch to get the best talent on their teams.\n \nIn this packed episode, auditionees include a punk fan whose twist of a pop classic melts the hearts of the coaches, a blast from the past with entertainer Bernie Clifton of Oswald the Ostrich fame, and plenty of piscine puns from a fishmonger with a unique voice.\n \nThe coaches kick off the new series with a roof-raising performance of You've Got the Whole Lotta Love before they take to the chairs for the first of seven blind audition shows."

Pierre is an outcast in society, and the illegitimate son of one of Russia's wealthiest men. But now his father is close to death and his scheming relatives are vying for the old man's fortune - though they expect Pierre to be left with nothing.\n\nPierre's dearest friend Prince Andrei Bolkonsky is excited for war with Napoleon. For him it offers a chance to find purpose in life by fighting on the front line. Unhappily married to a beautiful socialite, Lise, he plans to leave her behind at his fierce father's remote country estate and seek military glory for himself. The army under Andrei's wise mentor General Kutuzov expects a swift victory. But when the French unexpectedly prove their military might, Andrei is thrust into a dangerous battle.\n\nPierre's other great friend is Natasha Rostova - a beautiful, lively young woman growing up fast and desperate to experience more of the world. When she sees love blossom between her brother Nikolai and his childhood sweetheart Sonya, she is inspired for the first time with romantic thoughts of her own. As the men ride off to war, Natasha and Sonya are left behind to wait and wonder if they will ever return."
