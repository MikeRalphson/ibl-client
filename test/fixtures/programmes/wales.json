Between 1956 and 1960 British youth created a unique copy of a distant and scarce American original whilst most parents, professional jazz men and even the BBC did their level best to snuff it out. \n\nFrom its first faltering steps as a facsimile of Bill Haley's swing style to the sophistication of self-penned landmarks such as Shakin' All Over and The Sound of Fury, this is the story of how the likes of Lord Rockingham's XI, Vince Taylor and Cliff Richard and the Shadows laid the foundations for an enduring 50-year culture of rock 'n' roll. \n\nNow well into their seventies, the flame still burns strong in the hearts of the original young ones. Featuring Sir Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde, Joe Brown, Bruce Welch, Cherry Wainer and the Quarrymen."

When Kristian, Gianni and Dan formed The Wytches in 2011 they quickly realised they needed to relocate from the sleepy suburb from where they emerged. How could a gnarly cross between Link Wray and Nirvana possibly survive in such a subdued community (no offence)? So the lads jumped into their Wytch-­‐Mobile and headed off to the south coast to join the artistically charged Brighton community from where their thrilling act has gone from strength to strength. One of the great live bands of the moment. File under ‘Misspent Youth’. \n\n\n\nJesca Hoop grew up in a Mormon community in California. Aged 14 she cut her ties with organised religion and headed off into the wildness. There follows tales of Jesca disappearing into the desert for days, sleeping under a tree for a spell and eventually building a log cabin to live in. All this time Jesca was honing her guitar-­‐playing and songwriting skills... and after an encounter with Mancunian band Elbow in the States, Jesca upped sticks and followed the band to her new home in the North of England. She has a unique talent. Beautiful and often edgy songs. \n\n\n\nHaving been a familiar face around the pubs and clubs of the north east for many years now it was only in 2014 that Richard Dawson’s unbridled genius really made an impression on the wider music-­‐loving community. His most recent album is called Nothing Important: a groundbreaking masterpiece that includes within it a 16-­‐minute piece The Vile Stuff. It tells the tale of a group of schoolchildren on a school field trip, some of who partake in a mind-­‐bending cocktail of various alcohols. The results are both toe curling, hilarious... and riddled with genius."
