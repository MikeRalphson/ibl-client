Yet when Leslie decides to enact revenge on an old boyfriend, Dan quickly realises he is in way out of his depth.\n \nMeanwhile, Hannah is dreading heading in to work for the annual audit.

Martin heads to the Vic where Nancy tells him Stacey is upstairs with Arthur. But when he searches for them he doesn’t notice the door to the roof, ajar. Nancy and Tamwar head upstairs and realise that Stacey is on the roof. Nancy tries to coax Stacey down whilst Tamwar finds Martin. Stacey is desperate to see the stars. She explains that demons are after her and Arthur. Nancy tried to get her inside before the storm hits but Stacey believes the storm is being sent to her by God. Martin asks Tamwar not to let anyone know about what has happened, for Stacey’s sake. Martin tells Nancy and Tamwar to head inside though they are reluctant. Martin moves towards Stacey and she edges backwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe tells him Arthur isn’t his; he’s God’s. Kyle returns to the Vic to get his friends and tells them they need to go. He leaves the baby bag and Stacey’s phone on the bar. Stacey is waiting for a sign, a messenger from God. Martin plays along with her delusions. She allows him to come closer and he wraps Arthur in a blanket given to him by Nancy. Martin holds him and holds out his hand to Stacey to lead her home. Kush shouts for her from the Square. She trips and Martin saves her from falling. Martin guides her home and tells Nancy it was just the shock of Charlie’s death. Kush catches them on their way out of the Vic and is struggling with the fact that he can’t help Arthur. Once home, Stacey is comforted by Martin and tries to open the window so God can see them. Martin closes it and promises her he won’t let anyone take Arthur. \n\n\n\n\n\nBilly thanks the police outside Number 3 and prepares to collect Charlie’s body. Billy explains to Patrick that Charlie had a heart attack. Patrick goes to inform Dot. Charlie’s body is covered with a sheet on the sofa. Billy stares at him clutching the body bag, waiting for his work colleague to arrive. Alfie offers to help him after Kat and Mo have taken the children out of the room. Stacey returns with Martin and Arthur and Tommy has drawn a picture for Charlie. Kat struggles to explain Charlie’s death to the children and Alfie steps in to help. He says that Charlie is in heaven and is the brightest star in the sky. Stacey takes this in. Once the kids are put to bed, Kat thanks Alfie for always being there for her. Alfie looks at her, his mind on the test results. He tries to tell Kat but is interrupted by Mo and the entrance of Kat’s sister, Belinda. Belinda looks at Kat with hate and congratulates her for finally killing their dad… \n\n\n\n\n\nShabnam is distraught at the news that Kush is Arthur’s father and rushes to the door. Kush stops her from leaving and she locks herself in the bathroom. Carmel and Kush wait outside until Shabnam reappears. Martin arrives looking for Stacey and Shabnam tells him she saw her in the Square. She tells Kush to go and find them. Carmel explains that Kush was doing what he thought was best but Shabnam laughs at her, remembering the baby grow she gave to Stacey. She tells Carmel to go home. Shabnam sits alone whilst Kush searches for Stacey. She looks at her phone; nothing. \n\n\n\n\n\nPhil and Sharon sit at the kitchen table discussing Charlie’s death and how Sharon felt when she found out Dennis was hurt on Christmas Day. She will never be able to let go of her hate for Ian. Phil sneaks into the cupboard under the stairs and retrieves a bottle of whiskey. He finishes it and heads to the Vic. Shirley serves him and asks what’s happened. Later she finds him in the Arches drinking alone in the dark. He receives a message from Sharon asking him to come to the hospital. Phil tells Shirley that Ian wasn’t driving the car on Christmas day. Shirley tells him to tell Sharon the truth."

When Kyle suggests that they head somewhere warm, Stacey makes him promise that it won’t be back to the Square.  Kat leaves Stacey a worried voicemail, before suggesting to Mo that they should stay at home, in case she comes back.  In a café, Stacey claims to Kyle that she feels safest when she’s with him.  Stacey suggests that they go away somewhere. When Martin phones, Stacey rejects the call.  Martin and Kush rush into the Vic looking for Stacey, but Nancy states that she hasn’t seen her in the last hour. When Kyle suggests that they go to Great Yarmouth, Stacey states that it’s a perfect idea. When Stacey ignores yet another call from Martin, Kyle questions whether the pair of them have had an argument – Stacey claims that Martin thinks she’s going mad.  As Kyle goes to tell Stacey something, he’s interrupted by Martin calling Stacey again.\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle’s confused when Stacey claims that she thinks Arthur’s going to be taken away and that she needs to protect him from King Herod. When Stacey’s adamant that Brian spoke to her, Kyle realises that something’s seriously wrong.  As Stacey goes to change Arthur, Kyle picks up Stacey’s phone and calls Martin.  Kyle’s confused when Martin brands Kyle a fake. Kyle tells Martin that they’re in a café near Walford Park, just as Stacey emerges and grabs the phone off of Martin. Martin tells Stacey that Kyle isn’t her brother – Charlie told Kat that Brian never had another son.  Stacey shouts at Kyle that he’s the devil, before making a run for it.  Martin and Kush find Kyle outside the café – Kyle tells the pair that Stacey called him the devil; the pair acknowledge that it’s Stacey’s having problems with her bi-polar.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Stacey gets in a taxi, she’s confused to see   Charlie driving it – he tells her to go home and Stacey agrees to be taken back to the Square.  Martin’s defensive when Kush infers that Stacey might harm Arthur. Martin calls the police and reports Stacey as missing. Stacey’s confused when the driver drops her off – it’s not Charlie at all.  A teary Stacey looks up at the Vic roof and sobs to Arthur that his daddy needs to see him.  Stacey walks into the Vic and heads up the stairs. Kush is concerned when Carmel admits that she and Stacey had a bit of a run-in; whilst Martin continues the hunt.  Back at the flat, Shabnam overhears Kush call Arthur his son – Kush clocks Shabnam in the doorway. Stacey heads up to the roof of the Vic with Arthur, and tells him that God’s coming for him...\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Alfie and Phil wait for a cab outside the hospital, Alfie claims to Phil that his tumour is benign. Alfie reluctantly takes a call from Kat and afterwards tells Phil that Charlie’s died.  As Alfie laments over Charlie’s sudden death, he admits to Phil that he didn’t get the all clear. The tumour has stopped growing, but they’re going to have to operate if he gets symptoms. Alfie admits that he can’t bear the thought of telling Kat. Phil tells Alfie that he understands – he’s not told Sharon of his liver problems.  Phil and Alfie find a teary Sharon outside number 3- Sharon tells Alfie that Charlie looked peaceful.  As Alfie comforts Kat, she reassures him that she’s going to be okay. \n\n\n\n\n\nOver a glass of wine, Carmel confides in Denise about Shabnam’s bad news. Denise is bemused when Carmel mentions Arthur and talks about Kush having his own baby. Carmel covers when tears spring, claiming that she just feels emotional. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs Nancy serves up her and Tamwar’s dish, she informs Masood that it’s all going well.  Nancy’s surprised when Kyle’s friends try the dish and brand it disgusting, claiming it’s loaded with salt – Aunt Babe looks on smugly.  As Tamwar tries the ruined food, Nancy leaves Aunt Babe a disgruntled voicemail.  Nancy suggests to Masood that he helps cook up another batch of sauce – Masood agrees.  Nancy’s impressed with the amount of cash they managed to bring in from their takeover. Nancy’s pleased when Tamwar suggests that they make it a regular thing – he’d quit his job in order to have the time."

Presenting duo Emma Willis and Marvin Humes return to helm the unmissable Saturday night entertainment show.\n \nThe contest kicks off with the blind auditions, where the coaches begin the process of building their 12-strong teams by sitting with their backs to the auditionees and turning their chairs if they are impressed with what they hear. If more than one coach turns, the hopeful has the chance to choose whose team they join - and the fireworks begin as the coaches pitch to get the best talent on their teams.\n \nIn this packed episode, auditionees include a punk fan whose twist of a pop classic melts the hearts of the coaches, a blast from the past with entertainer Bernie Clifton of Oswald the Ostrich fame, and plenty of piscine puns from a fishmonger with a unique voice.\n \nThe coaches kick off the new series with a roof-raising performance of You've Got the Whole Lotta Love before they take to the chairs for the first of seven blind audition shows."

              "large": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is arguably the most important album in the mind-blowing career of David Bowie. Released in 1972, it's the record that set the mercurial musician on course to becoming one of the best-known pop stars on the planet. In just over a year, Bowie's messianic Martian invaded the minds of the nation's youth with a killer combination of extraterrestrial rock 'n' roll and outrageous sexuality, all delivered in high-heeled boots, multicoloured dresses and extravagant make-up. In Bowie's own words, Ziggy was 'a cross between Nijinsky and Woolworths', but this unlikely culture clash worked - Ziggy turned Bowie into stardust.\n \nThis documentary tells the story of how Bowie arrived at one of the most iconic creations in the history of pop music. The songs, the hairstyles, the fashion and the theatrical stage presentation merged together to turn David Bowie into the biggest craze since the Beatles. Ziggy's instant success gave the impression that he was the perfectly planned pop star. But, as the film reveals, it had been a momentous struggle for David Bowie to hit on just the right formula that would take him to the top.\n\nNarrated by fan Jarvis Cocker, it reveals Bowie's mission to the stars through the musicians and colleagues who helped him in his unwavering quest for fame - a musical voyage that led Bowie to doubt his true identity, eventually forcing the sudden demise of his alien alter ego, Ziggy.\n\nContributors include Trevor Bolder (bass player, Spiders from Mars), Woody Woodmansey (drummer, Spider from Mars), Mike Garson (Spiders' keyboardist), Suzi Ronson (Mick Ronson's widow, who gave Bowie that haircut), Ken Scott (producer), Elton John (contemporary and fan), Lindsay Kemp (Bowie's mime teacher), Leee Black Childers (worked for Mainman, Bowie's production company), Cherry Vanilla (Bowie's PA/press officer), George Underwood (Bowie's friend), Mick Rock (Ziggy's official photographer), Steve Harley, Marc Almond, Holly Johnson, Peter Hook, Jon Savage, Peter Doggett and Dylan Jones."

For most of the campers it's a last resort in their battle for health. But it's not just their fitness that is at stake - most have suffered severe bullying, social exclusion, anxiety and depression. \n\nThe camp takes a dynamic approach - every day is packed with physical exercise and sessions designed to help with nutritional knowledge and development of self-esteem. Meals are strictly calorie-controlled and there are weekly weigh-ins to measure progress. The rules on behaviour are tough and no phones, television or internet are allowed.\n\nIn the concluding episode, 13-year-old Stephen (whose starting weight at camp was 14 stone) has a history of challenging behaviour at school and it isn't long before his attitude is getting him into trouble. \n\nFifteen-year-old Amy (starting weight at camp 16 stone) comes with her twin sister Beth, who quickly decides to leave. For the first time in her life, Amy will have to survive without her twin. \n\nFourteen-year-old Sebastian (starting weight at camp 19 stone) flies in from his home in Switzerland, where he finds it difficult to make friends with other boys. But then he meets 17-year-old Jordan (starting weight at camp 18 and a half stone) and the boys quickly form a bond. \n\nFinally, there is another international camper in 14-year-old Rinat from Israel (starting weight 11 stone) who comes from a very affluent background and is used to getting her own way. When she doesn't, fireworks soon follow.",

In its fifth year, The Voice promises more talent, more tension and more drama than ever before.\n \nSuperstar coaches will.i.am and Ricky Wilson return to welcome legendary pop icon Boy George and multi-platinum-selling singer Paloma Faith to the famed spinning chair panel. Presenting duo Emma Willis and Marvin Humes return to helm the unmissable Saturday night entertainment show.\n \nThe contest kicks off with the blind auditions, where the coaches begin the process of building their 12-strong teams by sitting with their backs to the auditionees and turning their chairs if they are impressed with what they hear. If more than one coach turns, the hopeful has the chance to choose whose team they join - and the fireworks begin as the coaches pitch to get the best talent on their teams.\n \nIn this packed episode, auditionees include a punk fan whose twist of a pop classic melts the hearts of the coaches, a blast from the past with entertainer Bernie Clifton of Oswald the Ostrich fame, and plenty of piscine puns from a fishmonger with a unique voice.\n \nThe coaches kick off the new series with a roof-raising performance of You've Got the Whole Lotta Love before they take to the chairs for the first of seven blind audition shows.",

It's an epic tale that includes giant figures such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, the devastating struggle against Napoleon in 1812, and the political murders of Nicholas II and his family in 1918 which brought the dynasty to a brutal end.\n\nIn this first episode, Lucy investigates the beginning of the Romanovs' 300-year reign in Russia. In 1613, when Russia was leaderless, 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov was plucked from obscurity and offered the crown of Russia. Mikhail was granted absolute power and began the reign of the Romanovs as the most influential dynasty in modern European history.\n\nLucy also charts the story of Peter the Great, the ruthless and ambitious tsar who was determined to modernise Russia at the end of the 17th century. Lucy traces Peter's accession to the throne as a nine-year-old, when he witnessed a revolt led by royal guards and the slaughter of his uncles and close advisors. Sixteen years later, Peter would vengefully execute a thousand rebellious guards. Throughout his reign, Peter would demonstrate an unwavering commitment to establishing Russia as a naval power - Lucy explores the lengths to which Peter would go to ensure this became a reality, including the creation of a new maritime capital, St Petersburg.\n\nLucy shows how the Romanovs embraced and sponsored the arts on an astonishing scale - from building spectacular palaces to commissioning grand artworks - that all still dazzle today.\n\nAs well as studying this unique royal family, Lucy also considers the impact the Romanovs had on the lives of ordinary Russians, who were often little better than slaves to the elite.",

For most of the campers it's a last resort in their battle for health. But it's not just their fitness that is at stake - most have suffered severe bullying, social exclusion, anxiety and depression. \n\nThe camp takes a dynamic approach - every day is packed with physical exercise and sessions designed to help with nutritional knowledge and development of self-esteem. Meals are strictly calorie-controlled and there are weekly weigh-ins to measure progress. The rules on behaviour are tough and no phones, television or internet are allowed.\n\nIn this opening episode of two, we meet 15-year-old Katie who weighs 17 and a half stone - she's confident and happy on the outside, but admits that her sense of humour is a form of self-defence. Katie has tried countless diets and is desperate to break the cycle of compulsive eating. But her attitude to the rigorous exercise programme on camp doesn't inspire confidence. \n\nAt 19 and a half stone, 14-year-old Lana is the heaviest girl on camp. She acts as a carer for her disabled mum and life has been tough for her. Can she find a new confidence in just five weeks? Meanwhile, 15-year-old Adam who weighs 20 stone, struggles with camp from the start - he finds the rules repressive and just wants to go home. His mum, whose biggest fear is that her son will die before she does, refuses to let him return. But eventually, Adam takes matters into his own hands.",

Using the latest technology, David dives into the shark-infested waters of Osprey Reef in the Triton submersible. \n\nSixty years after his first visit to Raine Island, he returns to the nesting grounds of the green sea turtle and at Lady Elliot Island marvels at manta ray cleaning stations. New tracking technology allows David to follow the story of visitors like the dwarf minke whales. Stunning satellite imagery and computer animation reveal their journey and David discovers their surprising reasons for returning and why the reef is vital for their survival.",

He meets some of the tiny coral animals that built the reef and helped to turn it into an underwater wonderland. He then takes to the skies to witness the vast scale of their endeavour, a living structure that provides a home for thousands of species. \n\nUsing cutting-edge technology to generate computer scans of the sea floor, David learns that the Great Barrier Reef we know today is much younger than scientists ever imagined. He meets some of the people that have lived alongside it and who have told stories of its origins for thousands of years.\n\nAt the beautiful Lizard Island research station, David explores newly discovered research which uncovers a complex community of animals who form remarkable relationships among the coral. But none of this great diversity would be here if it were not for one extraordinary event that happens every year, providing a spectacular finale: the annual coral spawning.",

With a trail of clues leading from one crime scene to the next, Schenk and his team must work out the twisted logic that connects each victim. But this murdering mastermind is more than a match for the police, outsmarting them at every step.

The pair speculate on whether having a priest accompanying him to the pearly gates improves or damages Adrian's chances of entry to heaven.\n\nAdrian then joins the faithful in St Peter's Square to listen to the man he describes as 'chairman and chief executive' of his own religion. Later, an 80-year-old cardinal tries to remain unflustered as Adrian makes his first confession in eight years. It takes a while.\n\nHe observes the Sabbath with a Jewish family, but his brief flirtation with Judaism is cut short when he learns that becoming a Jew is not quite as simple as wanting to join. He cooks with the nuns of Marseille, and visits a Roman Catholic school where 80% of the children are Muslims and where he declares the head teacher to be 'the most inspiring person I have ever met'.",
